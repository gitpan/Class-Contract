	- original version; created by h2xs 1.18
	  (very much alpha)


0.05	Wed Nov 24 14:11:22 1999

	- First beta version

1.00	Sun Aug  6 07:11:35 2000

	- Changed semantics of preconditions.
	  Now only inherited if not defined in same class
	  (this conforms with the notion of derived classes
	  being allowed to weaken, but not strengthen preconditions).

	- Added postconditions on SCALAR, ARRAY, and HASH attributes

	- Added &value for attr conditions

	- Removed &result -- now uses &value instead

	- Added warning when explicit preconditions in derived
	  class override inherited preconditions from base class.

	- Added default ctor ('new') if none specified.

	- Modified flyweight implementation (more robust, secure, and
	  efficient)

	- Modified ctors to refuse to instantiate classes with
	  1+ abstract methods.

	- Added class constructors and destructors

	- Changed production code mechanism
	  (now a separate, accelerated class: Class::Contract::Production)
