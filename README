==============================================================================


NAME
    Class::Contract - Design-by-Contract OO in Perl

DESCRIPTION
    The Class::Contract module implements strong encapsulation, static
    inheritance, and design-by-contract condition checking for
    object-oriented Perl. The module provides a declarative syntax for
    attribute, method, constructor, and destructor definitions at both
    the object and class level. Pre-conditions, post-conditions, and
    class invariants are also fully supported.
